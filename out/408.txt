 		       <sentence>pittsburgh supercomputing center
                          mellon institute bldg.</sentence>
			third floor conference room             
				oct 11, <stime>4:00</stime> p.m.

(if you don't know where this room is, meet at 3:45 p.m. at the 5th floor 
entrance and we can walk over together.)

          <sentence>the tera computer system is a scalable shared memory mimd computer.</sentence>
	  <sentence>although it has no vector instructions, the 256 processor version
	  will have peak performance of about 300 gflops.</sentence>  <sentence>the arithmetic
	  will conform to ieee standard 754.  the system's i/o cache, used 
	  with disk arrays, will enable file system bandwidths of 70
	  gigabytes per second or more.</sentence>  <sentence>the languages available will be
	  fortran 77, c and c++, and the programming environment will support
	  a mixture of explicit programmer-generated and aggressive compiler-
	  generated parallelism.</sentence>  <sentence>tools will be provided to help users 
	  re-engineer programs for parallel execution and to debug optimized,
	  parallelized code.</sentence>  <sentence>a 16-processor system will be available for
	  customer benchmarking in first quarter 1991.  first system 
	  deliveries are scheduled for fourth quarter 1993.</sentence>

<paragraph>	  <sentence>the talk will describe the overall architecture of the system and
	  its hardware implementation; the programming environment and
	  associated tools; the operating system, including the file system;
	  and the company's status and long-range plans.</sentence></paragraph>
