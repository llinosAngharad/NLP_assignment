"some necessary conditions for a good user interface"

for our final human-computer interaction seminar of the semester, raj reddy
will be presenting his thoughts on what makes a good interface good.  he
hopes the discussion of "necessary conditions" can serve as a source for
new hci research ideas.  should be a thought-provoking way to transition to
the summer!
