friends, 
the illusions of carnival have forced us to move the ri faculty candidate
seminar to smith hall 125.  see you there.  a million thanks to cleah and a
number of other folks for helping out with the sudden switch.  best, mike

                piezoelectric ultrasonic micromotors

    utilizing the large piezoelectric coefficients and high dielectric
constants of ferroelectric thin films, it is possible to
microfabricate ultrasonic motors on silicon substrates.  this talk
will describe our efforts in this area.  by using ferroelectric thin
films of lead zirconate titanate (pzt), a two-order of magnitude
improvement over bulk ceramic materials is obtained in breakdown
strength.  this characteristic, in combination with high dielectric
permittivities, leads to a three-order of magnitude improvement over
electrostatic micromotors in terms of energy densities.

    we have fabricated resonant structures on one micron thick silicon
nitride membranes which are able to spin two-millimeter diameter
rotors which are placed down on top.  stator-rotor interaction is
achieved through frictional coupling and an inherent geardown creates
motors which run at low speeds with high torques.

    i will also discuss experiments with 8 mm diameter ultrasonic
motors fabricated from bulk ceramic pzt and an analysis of the contact
mechanics at the rotor-stator interface where the overall efficiency
of the motor is critically determined.  models of line contact,
hertzian contact and linear spring contact for coulomb and viscous
friction have been derived and simulations will be presented which
predict speed-torque curves, efficiencies and overall output power for
various conditions of operating voltage and normal force.

   work in progress on a new laser-etching technique for piezoelectric
ultrasonic micromotors offers promise for simplifying the fabrication
steps and developing more practical motors. we plan to incorporate
these actuators into small robots and create truly integrated
intelligent machines.  presently, we are developing small palm-sized
autonomous robots, using conventional electromagnetic motors, with
onboard computers and 18 sensors which can crawl through tubes, pick
up small objects and cooperate on tasks.  later, ultrasonic motors
will be retrofit as they become available, enabling miniaturization.
i will show videotapes of these machines in a robotic ant colony and
as intestine crawlers for telepresence surgery.
