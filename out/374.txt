<paragraph>this talk describes an environment to derive efficient parallel
implementations from program specifications using stepwise 
refinement.  the environment is built around a data parallel
notation called uc.  novel aspects of uc include:</paragraph>

* support for the design of rapid prototypes 
* incremental refinements for efficiency via dynamic data 
  distributions and progressively weaker synchronizations
* portability across synchronous and asynchronous architectures
* simple control-flow constructs to ensure that correctness 
  proofs are no more complicated than for equivalent 
  sequential programs.

<paragraph>a uc compiler is available for the cm-2; a sequential emulator 
for uc is also available and a multicomputer implementation 
is in progress.  measurements of the uc compiler on selected 
numerical and graph applications will be presented.</paragraph>
