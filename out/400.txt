 abstract:  we often make decisions on the basis of very restricted
 information.  <sentence>how are we then to measure the quality of such decisions?</sentence>
 <sentence>the economist leonard savage proposed in the 1950's that the outcome of
 such on-line decisions be compared with the optimum outcome, achievable
 if complete information had been available.</sentence> <sentence>recent research by computer
 scientists in on-line algorithms has shown the wide applicability of this
 idea.</sentence>  

<paragraph><sentence>i am going to review on-line algorithms for terrain navigation and
exploration, compiling for parallel machines, and distributed optimization.</sentence>
<sentence>i shall also discuss how on-line algorithms can help determine the value of
information and improve the organization of the decision-making process.</sentence></paragraph>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<paragraph><sentence>this talk is the next in a series of live, interactive video conferences
that will be held every wednesday 7 pm - 8:30 pm between january 20 and
may 5 1993.  these conferences are being organized by a few west coast
schools, hence the name, the west coast colloquium.</sentence>  <sentence>this will be something
of a multiple university distinguished speakers series.</sentence>  <sentence>the participants,
so far, are berkeley, stanford, washington, ucla, uc san diego, uc santa
barbara, and us.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>the technology is picturetel based with conference bridging by at&t.</sentence>  <sentence>there
will be multiple monitors at each site;  cameras at every site are voice
activated to force the display to show that site, so that the distributed
audience can have camera time to ask questions.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>wednesday's seminars are still experiemental.</sentence>  <sentence>many sites have yet to
get all the equipment working for such an ambitious conference call.</sentence>
<sentence>even if everything is working well, there will be a noticeable lag
between your speech and its broadcast to your and others' monitors.</sentence></paragraph>
