			      ubiquitous computing

<paragraph><sentence>inspired  by  the social scientists, philosophers, and anthropologists at parc,
we have been trying to take a radical look at what computing ought to be  like.</sentence>
<sentence>two  key  points  are:  people  live in an environmental surround, using space,
muscle memory, 3-d body surround; and that people live through their  practices
and  tacit  knowledge  so  that  the  most  powerful  things are those that are
effectively invisible in use.</sentence>  <sentence>how  can  we  make  everyday  computing  conform
better  to these principles of human effectiveness, while avoiding the traps of
virtual reality ?</sentence>  <sentence>our approach:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>activate the world.</sentence>  <sentence>provide hundreds of wireless computing devices per  person
per  office, of all scales (from 1" displays to wall sized).</sentence> <sentence>we are doing o.s.,
wireless  lan,  u.i.,  packaging,  display,  pen,  handwriting,  protocol,  and
interoperability  research  to  help bring this about.</sentence>  <sentence>we call it: "ubiquitous
computing".</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>we are completely off the workstation, pc, and pda track.</sentence>  <sentence>these things in  the
office,  every place you are, are not personal.</sentence>  <sentence>you just grab anything that is
nearby, and use it.</sentence>  <sentence>your information and state follows you,  the  hundreds  of
devices in your office or meeting room adjust to support you.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>we  are not all that far along, this is a ten to twenty year quest.</sentence>  <sentence>we do have
some prototype devices working.</sentence>  <sentence>in this talk  i'll  describe  the  origins  of
ubiquitous  computing,  the  research  approach, and some specific scenarios of
future computing that we  consider  important.</sentence>    <sentence>i'll  distinguish  ubiquitous
computing  from  notebook, palmtop, multimedia, personal digital assistant, gui
and virtual reality computing.</sentence>  <sentence>and i'll describe some of the current state  of
our hardware and software.</sentence></paragraph>
