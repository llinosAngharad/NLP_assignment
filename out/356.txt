<paragraph><sentence>i will describe our research in automating the kinematic analysis of
rigid part mechanisms, such as gears, cylinder locks, clutches, and
transmissions.</sentence>  <sentence>kinematic analysis determines the constraints on the
behavior of a mechanism imposed by the shapes of its parts and by the
contacts among them.</sentence>  <sentence>automating the analysis is an important step
toward automating the overall design and analysis of mechanisms.</sentence>  <sentence>the
computational complexity of kinematic analysis depends on the shapes
and motion types of the parts of the mechanism, and is in general
intractable.</sentence>  <sentence>we have identified engineering restrictions on part
shapes and interactions that make kinematic analysis feasible.</sentence>  <sentence>most
mechanisms belong to the feasible class according to a survey of 2500
mechanisms in a standard mechanical engineering encyclopedia.</sentence>  <sentence>we have
developed an efficient kinematic analysis program for feasible
mechanisms.</sentence>  <sentence>the program derives the motion of the parts for given
input motions and internal forces, such as gravity and friction.</sentence>  <sentence>it
uses a simple model of dynamics that captures the steady-state effect
of forces without the conceptual and computational cost of traditional
dynamical simulation.</sentence>  <sentence>it generates a compact, symbolic behavioral
description and a realistic, three-dimensional animation.</sentence>  <sentence>it can also
generate the space of behaviors for all possible input motions.</sentence></paragraph>
