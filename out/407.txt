abstract: 

  scs will sponsor a seminar on ways to achieve a healthy
office environment at 1 p.m. wednesday, may 12th, in wean
hall 5409.
  the speaker will be karlis mateus, a representative of
steelcase, inc., the office equipment manufacturer.  he will
focus on the ways in which poorly designed office furniture
can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome and other illnesses.

  i have asked mr. mateus to keep the discussion as generic as
possible.  however, i do anticipate he will use some illustrations
of steelcase products during his presentation.
