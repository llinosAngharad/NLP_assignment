we report about projects and activities in parallel computing at cscs'
section of research and development (serd). the {\em joint cscs-eth/nec
high performance computing software development center} is a
collaboration with nec corporation comprising ten full-time scientists
working in a user- and application-driven way on tools for
parallelization support, performance monitoring, and debugging, as well
as applications and algorithms for distributed memory parallel
processor systems (dmpps). another project, {\em a tool environment
for parallel programming of distributed systems} is funded by the swiss
national science foundation in the framework of the swiss priority
program informatics (sppif).  it's long-term research goal is to build
a problem solving environment for convenient programming of dmpps. the
environment is founded on a specification-level formalism tailored to
the needs of computational scientists and successfully addresses the
issues of performance, portability, extensibility and software reuse.
cscs' {\em summer student internship program} (ssip), for the first
time carried through in the summer of 1993, transforms the research and
development results into the educational sector.  cscs' parallel
computer systems and education laboratory (paredlab) provides a
framework for education and training on novel computer architectures
and software systems, knowledge acquisition in the field of
high-performance computing, and consultation of academic institutions
and industrial and commercial companies.
