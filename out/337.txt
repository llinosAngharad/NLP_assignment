 title: the programmable automated welding system

<paragraph><sentence>the trend toward manufacturing in small lot sizes continues, imposing
ever new demands on the responsiveness of companies to consumer demands.</sentence>
 <sentence>to be cost competitive, this requires the designer to perform part of
the manufacturing planning early in the design phase.</sentence>  <sentence>towards this end
a number of decision support tools have been developed, providing
designers with vital information regarding the manufacturability of a
part or a product.</sentence>  <sentence>part of any manufacturability study includes the
simulations of the processes involved.</sentence>  <sentence>it is important that the
designer can investigate different manufacturing scenerios and
succesfully choose one within the constraints of his organization or the
ones he can easily access.</sentence>  <sentence>dr. prinz will describe the requirements of
an environment in which a part can be designed incorparating both the
geometric and non-geometric information required for a complete
product/manufacturing process description.</sentence>  </paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>his presentation will describe the non-procedural programable automated
welding-system (paws) package.</sentence>  <sentence>this system has three major components,
namely, a non-manifold solid modeler for part, equipment, and
environment definition, an sql (standard query language) compatible
database for process definition, and a robotic motion planning module
capable of motion optimization, interference detection and graphic
simulation.</sentence>  <sentence>although this system focuses on the welding process, the
key components of the system are equally relevant to other manufacturing
strategies such as grinding, spraying, deburring, and cutting.</sentence></paragraph>
