 title:  using two-dimensional image matching to interpret the three-dimensional world

<paragraph>we are investigating the extent to which two-dimensional representations
are applicable to tasks that involve interacting with the three-dimensional
world.  we have been using two-dimensional geometry extracted from images to
solve a number of problems, including tracking moving objects, segmenting
images based on motion, and navigating a mobile robot to a target.  our
methods are based on comparing portions of one image with another, under
various transformations, using the generalized hausdorff measure.  this
measure determines the resemblance of point sets (binary images) by
examining the fraction of points in one set that are near points in the
other (and perhaps vice versa).  unlike most measures used in model-based
matching, this measure is not based on computing a correspondence between
points in the two sets.</paragraph>

<paragraph>in this talk, i will describe the generalized hausdorff measure, discuss how
to compute it efficiently, and then present applications of the measure to
motion tracking and visually guided navigation problems.</paragraph>
