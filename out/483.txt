how to fix computers
usefulness, usability and productivity.</paragraph>

<paragraph>tom landauer
director, cognitive science research
bellcore</paragraph>

<paragraph>in the last five years or so, many economists and associated pundits
have born much bad news about the effect of computers on productivity.
i'll show you the data, and conclude that things probably are just as
bad as they seem.</paragraph>

<paragraph>then we'll look for root causes and possible cures. the main problem is that
computer applications are of little help for improving the efficiency of the
routine mental work of the information economy, and have been improving too
slowly. the good news is that simple, cheap, empirical usability
evaluation and redesign can turn the situation around. fairly compelling
evidence will be displayed. </paragraph>
