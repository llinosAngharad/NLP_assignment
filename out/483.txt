how to fix computers
usefulness, usability and productivity.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>tom landauer
director, cognitive science research
bellcore</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>in the last five years or so, many economists and associated pundits
have born much bad news about the effect of computers on productivity.</sentence>
<sentence>i'll show you the data, and conclude that things probably are just as
bad as they seem.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>then we'll look for root causes and possible cures.</sentence> <sentence>the main problem is that
computer applications are of little help for improving the efficiency of the
routine mental work of the information economy, and have been improving too
slowly.</sentence> <sentence>the good news is that simple, cheap, empirical usability
evaluation and redesign can turn the situation around.</sentence> <sentence>fairly compelling
evidence will be displayed.</sentence> </paragraph>
