<paragraph>   <sentence>risc in a robotics context stands for reduced intricacy in sensing and
   control.</sentence>  <sentence>but it shares the same philosophy as risc computer design.</sentence>
   <sentence>the idea is to replace complicated manipulation and sensing steps with
   combinations of simple ones.</sentence>  <sentence>industrial robotics research has focussed
   on anthropomorphism in the hope that once robots become sufficiently
   human-like, they will be able to solve all the tasks that they are
   currently incapable of doing.</sentence>  <sentence>this approach is seductive and has led
   researchers further and further away from the real problems that
   hinder the proliferation of robots in manufacturing.</sentence>  <sentence>the enthusiasm
   for robotics in industry which reached a peak in the mid 80's has all
   but disappeared after a protracted lack of progress on these problems.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>   <sentence>as whitney [1] and others have argued, even if robots with human-like
   dexterity and flexibility could be built, and they are clearly decades
   away, they will be completely impractical economically.</sentence>  <sentence>the problem
   is that robots, at least in an industrial setting, need more dexterity
   and sensing capability than they have today, but far less than a human
   being.</sentence>  <sentence>we are trying a risc approach to achieving this capability.</sentence>  <sentence>we
   achieve complicated manipulation and sensing performance by using
   *just enough* simple elements, namely:</sentence></paragraph>

	 * dextrous manipulation is replaced by two or three
	   transfer/grasping steps with simple, specialized grippers.

	 * dense sensor input like vision or tactile or rangefinder 
	   data is replaced by very low resolution sensors, like finger gap,
	   optical beam or low-resolution tactile.

<paragraph>   <sentence>this lets us build fast, cheap, simple, robust systems now rather than
   later.</sentence>  <sentence>the sensors are small and inexpensive enough that they can be
   placed throughout the environment, including on every gripper, so that
   each operation can be monitored throughout a task.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>   <sentence>this talk will give an overview of the approach, and some of the new
   research problems that it suggests.</sentence>  <sentence>then we will describe some recent
   results on beam sensing.</sentence>  <sentence>in particular, we find that processing beam
   data provides object recognition times in milliseconds rather than
   minutes, and much finer localization than is possible with vision.</sentence>  <sentence>if
   a sensor provides few accurate values (rather than an enormous number
   of inaccurate ones as with vision), recognition reduces to a hash
   table lookup.</sentence></paragraph>
