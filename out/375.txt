 title:	elemental measurements in vision.</sentence>

<paragraph><sentence>what are the "elements" of early vision?</sentence> <sentence>i will discuss a unifying framework under which the basic visual measurements can be derived in a consistent manner.</sentence>  <sentence>first we must consider the structure of the
light in which a visual organism is immersed; this may be formalized with the "plenoptic function," which is related to gibson's concept of the optic array.</sentence>  <sentence>derivative operators on this function produce measurements of form, motion, color, flicker, disparity, and so on.</sentence> <sentence>we can derive a kind of periodic table of early vision.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>i will also discuss some of our work on early vision using "steerable filters" and "steerable pyramids" to analyze orientation, scale, local energy, and so on.</sentence>  <sentence>the steerable pyramid has advantages over other multiscale image decompositions -- including the currently popular orthogonal wavelet transforms.</sentence></paragraph>
