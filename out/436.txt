programmable applications for scientists and artists

programmable applications are software systems that combine the
learnability and accessibility of direct manipulation interfaces with
the expressive range of "domain-enriched" programming environments.
while -- broadly speaking -- the notions of direct manipulation and
programming have historically been viewed as existing in opposition,
programmable applications seek to blend language and direct
manipulation constructs in mutually supportive ways. this talk will
describe some of the issues that arise in the design of programmable
applications, and will present two prototype applications (based on
the scheme programming language) for the domains of graphic design and
computational physics.
