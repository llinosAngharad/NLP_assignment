abstract: 

<paragraph><sentence>prof patterson has demonstrated classical "absent-minded
professor" symptoms.</sentence>  <sentence>the abstract posted a few days ago
is not the talk that he plans to give.</sentence>  <sentence>instead, he appears
to be giving the talk we saw last spring in our distinguished
lecture series.</sentence>  <sentence>it was good then, so if you missed it or
would like a reprise, come tomorrow evening.</sentence>    ----  garth</paragraph>

	         <sentence>west coast computer science colloquium

		      terabytes >> teraflops
	or why work on processors when i/o is where the action is?</sentence>

<paragraph>			david a. patterson
	   professor and chair, computer science division,
	  eecs department, university of california, berkeley</paragraph>

                        <stime>7:15 </stime>- <etime>8:15 pm</etime>
                        <location>4623 wean hall</location>
                (via picturetel from berkeley)
                moderated locally by garth gibson
[[[[[[  this is likely to be similar to the distinguished lecture given by
	patterson here at cmu last spring.    ---  garth  ]]]]]]]

<paragraph><sentence>amdahl's law tells us with faster processors we
need faster and larger i/o.</sentence> <sentence>unfortunately disks are getting smaller rather
than faster.</sentence>  <sentence>this talk describes the results of the raid project
(redundant arrays of inexpensive disks), which offers much
greater performance, capacity, and reliablity from i/o systems.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>i will also talk about a new project getting underway called sequoia 2000,
which looks at utilizing small helical scan tapes, such as
digital-audio tapes or video tapes, to offer terabytes of
storage for the price of a fileserver.</sentence> (sequoia 2000 is the digital
equipment corporation funded successor to mit's project athena;
it promises terabytes of economical and low latency storage
for global change scientists at the university of california.)</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>my thesis is that a factor of 1000 increase in storage capacity available
on most ethernets will have a much greater impact than a factor of
1000 increase in processing speed for a gaggle of scientists.</sentence></paragraph>
