   it  has been five years since i stopped working on andrew, so the freedom
   of information act -- along with the passing from power of several people
   --  allows  me  to  tell  some  candid stories about it. <sentence>in 1983, the itc
   started and grew to about 30 people.</sentence> <sentence>eight were ibmers, ten  or  so  were
   newly  minted  ph.d.s  from  our  very  own  department.</sentence> <sentence>we built andrew,
   partially in the model of spice and the alto  system.</sentence>  <sentence>it  achieved  some
   real  successes  but  didn't accomplish all that we'd hoped.</sentence>  <sentence>much of the
   problem was intrinsic to the way the world is, compared to how we thought
   it   was.</sentence>   <sentence>i   often  meet  people  who  still  have  some  of  my  1982
   misperceptions.</sentence>

<paragraph>   <sentence>i will reconsider some of the early,  crucial  decisions  of  the  andrew
   project  related  to  wiring,  protocols, workstations, file systems, and
   software.</sentence> <sentence>i'll assess the impact of andrew on education and discuss  what
   ibm  and  cmu  ultimately  got  out  of  it.</sentence>  <sentence>i will argue that unix, the
   macintosh, and electronic mail will not survive to the next century.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>   <sentence>finally, i'll offer eight opinions that computer scientists  who  venture
   into the real world should consider:</sentence></paragraph>

      <sentence>1. slowness kills.</sentence>

      <sentence>2. big, integrated systems lose.</sentence>

      <sentence>3. virtual << real.</sentence>

      <sentence>4. programmer productivity is not so important.</sentence>

      <sentence>5. technology transfer rarely works.</sentence>

      <sentence>6. engineers don't buy; they log roll.</sentence>

      <sentence>7. industrial funding is difficult.</sentence>

      8. <sentence>2nd system < 1st system < 3rd system.</sentence>
