   it  has been five years since i stopped working on andrew, so the freedom
   of information act -- along with the passing from power of several people
   --  allows  me  to  tell  some  candid stories about it. in 1983, the itc
   started and grew to about 30 people. eight were ibmers, ten  or  so  were
   newly  minted  ph.d.s  from  our  very  own  department. we built andrew,
   partially in the model of spice and the alto  system.  it  achieved  some
   real  successes  but  didn't accomplish all that we'd hoped.  much of the
   problem was intrinsic to the way the world is, compared to how we thought
   it   was.   i   often  meet  people  who  still  have  some  of  my  1982
   misperceptions.

   i will reconsider some of the early,  crucial  decisions  of  the  andrew
   project  related  to  wiring,  protocols, workstations, file systems, and
   software. i'll assess the impact of andrew on education and discuss  what
   ibm  and  cmu  ultimately  got  out  of  it.  i will argue that unix, the
   macintosh, and electronic mail will not survive to the next century.

   finally, i'll offer eight opinions that computer scientists  who  venture
   into the real world should consider:

      1. slowness kills.

      2. big, integrated systems lose.

      3. virtual << real.

      4. programmer productivity is not so important.

      5. technology transfer rarely works.

      6. engineers don't buy; they log roll.

      7. industrial funding is difficult.

      8. 2nd system < 1st system < 3rd system.
