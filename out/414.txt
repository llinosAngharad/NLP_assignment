	scalable parallel computing meets mainstream computing

the recently announced ibm 9076 scalable powerparallel 1 (9076 sp1) system
is the first in a family of scalable systems for serial and parallel
applications.   the sp1 leverages on the risc/6000 technology, and each node
is the equivalent of a workstation that provides a standard unix aix
interface.  thus, the sp1 provides all the functionality of a cluster of
workstations.  in addition, it provides system integration, hardware support
for high performance communication and a parallel programming environment.
this design point has obvious advantages: leverage on commodity technology,
and full support of all interfaces available on a workstation for serial
applications (unix aix, virtual memory, unix file system, ip connectivity,
compilers, libraries, etc.).  on the other hand, since standard unix is not
``parallel aware'', a separate parallel operating environment needs to be
created, in support of parallelism.  the talk will discuss some of the
technological trade-offs between ``commodization'' and customization, and
speculate on the likely evolution of systems that attend to preserve
standard uniprocessor interfaces, while supporting efficient scalable
parallel computing.
