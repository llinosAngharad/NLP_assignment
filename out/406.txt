<paragraph>  the functionality of the software and the techniques applied
  to elicit and analyze the requirements. </paragraph>

- eeps and hlc software architectures.

<paragraph>  the proposed high-level designs for the software and the
  process that led to the architectures.</paragraph>

- t2  process handbook.

<paragraph>  a set of management practices adopted by the team and collected
  for use by other software development teams.</paragraph>

- t2 time expenditures.
