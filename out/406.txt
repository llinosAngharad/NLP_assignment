the mse studio team will relate its spring semester experience
with the t2 project - providing software for the field robotics
center's tessellator robot. the tessellator is designed to service
the space shuttles' thermal protection system. 

the team formulated the requirements and drafted designs for
both the high-level controller (hlc) and the end-effector
positioning software (eeps). these activities mark the half-way
point of the t2 project. 

the presentation will include the following topics:

- t2 past and future.

  an overview of the events of the spring and an outlook
  on the summer semester.

- eeps and hlc requirements.

  the functionality of the software and the techniques applied
  to elicit and analyze the requirements. 

- eeps and hlc software architectures.

  the proposed high-level designs for the software and the
  process that led to the architectures.

- t2  process handbook.

  a set of management practices adopted by the team and collected
  for use by other software development teams.

- t2 time expenditures.

  some statistics on how the t2 developers spent their time.
