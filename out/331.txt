        eliminating combinatorics from the match in rule-based systems

                                 <speaker>milind tambe</speaker>

                                   abstract

eliminating combinatorics from the match in production systems  (or  rule-based
systems)  is  important  for  various  reasons  like real-time performance, the
utility issue in machine learning, parallel implementations and modeling  human
cognition.    the goal of this work is to eliminate match combinatorics without
sacrificing production system functionality.

  combinatorics arise in production match due to the ambiguity about which data
items (or working memory elements) can actually match a production's condition.
in a production with multiple conditions, a cascading effect of such  ambiguity
may  lead  to  an  exponential  match effort. we have investigated a variety of
approaches to eliminate match combinatorics, and have focused on the  following
two that appear quite promising:

   - the  unique-attribute  approach:  this approach restricts the working
     memory representation and completely eliminates the ambiguity.

   - the tokenless-match approach: this approach changes the match process
     so  as to allow some local ambiguity, but avoids the cascading effect
     that leads to combinatorics.

  i  will  present  detailed  theoretical  and  experimental  analyses  of  the
performance    improvements    possible   with   these   approaches   and   the
representational tradeoffs involved in them.
