 topic:     algorithms for square roots of graphs

<paragraph><sentence>the {\em kth power} of a graph  g = (v, e), written g^k,
is defined to be the graph having v as its vertex set with
vertices u, v adjacent in g^k if and only if
there exists a path of length at most k between them.</sentence>
<sentence>similarly, graph h has a {\em kth root} g if g^k = h.
powers of graphs have several interesting properties.</sentence>
<sentence>for example, the square of any biconnected graph and the
cube of any connected graph is hamiltonian.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>in this talk, we present algorithms to find a square
root g of a graph g^2 for the following special classes of graphs:</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>	<sentence>find g given g^2, where g is a tree, in o(m) time.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>	<sentence>find g given g^2, where g^2 is planar, in o(n) time.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>	<sentence>find g given g^2, where g is a subdivided graph, in o(m n) time.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>finding square roots of subdivided graphs is equivalent to inverting
total graphs.</sentence>
<sentence>in addition, we present several results on the complexity
of finding maximum cliques and hamiltonian cycles in powers of graphs.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>this is joint work with yaw-ling lin.</sentence></paragraph>
