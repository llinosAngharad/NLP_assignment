 topic:     algorithms for square roots of graphs

<paragraph>the {\em kth power} of a graph  g = (v, e), written g^k,
is defined to be the graph having v as its vertex set with
vertices u, v adjacent in g^k if and only if
there exists a path of length at most k between them.
similarly, graph h has a {\em kth root} g if g^k = h.
powers of graphs have several interesting properties.
for example, the square of any biconnected graph and the
cube of any connected graph is hamiltonian.</paragraph>

<paragraph>in this talk, we present algorithms to find a square
root g of a graph g^2 for the following special classes of graphs:</paragraph>

<paragraph>	find g given g^2, where g is a tree, in o(m) time.</paragraph>

<paragraph>	find g given g^2, where g^2 is planar, in o(n) time.</paragraph>

<paragraph>	find g given g^2, where g is a subdivided graph, in o(m n) time.</paragraph>

<paragraph>finding square roots of subdivided graphs is equivalent to inverting
total graphs.
in addition, we present several results on the complexity
of finding maximum cliques and hamiltonian cycles in powers of graphs.</paragraph>

<paragraph>this is joint work with yaw-ling lin.</paragraph>
