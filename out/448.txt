     the  speaker will describe his rather unexpected experiences as a
     mere technologist in the corridors of  power  in  washington.  <sentence>by
     being  in  the  right place at the right time, he was selected as
     co-chair of the white house information  technology  task  force,
     which   was   tasked   during  the  early  days  of  the  clinton
     administration  to  recommend  a  new  computer  system  for  the
     executive  office  of  the  president.</sentence>    <sentence>his experiences include
     bringing  the  internet  to  the  white  house  and  establishing
     internet   accounts   for   the   president  and  vice  president
     (president,vice.president@whitehouse.gov), participating  on  the
     vice  president's  national  performance  review  to  re-engineer
     government through information technology, almost  knocking  over
     the president with a laserprinter, and inspecting the fiber optic
     network on board air force one.</sentence>
