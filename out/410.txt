argument and arbitration games</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>we begin with two points about modeling reasoning that herbert simon
and nicholas rescher made well, but which were lost in the ai shuffle:
1) rational belief can be constructed by the right kind of
resource-bounded process; 2) dialectic is one of the right kinds of
process.</sentence>  <sentence>a protocol for disputation is essentially a model of an
automated reasoner's search procedure.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>we describe programs and card games which model case-based legal
argument and reasoned settlement.</sentence></paragraph>
