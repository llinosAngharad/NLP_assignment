	    <sentence>as an alternative to complex and fattening topics in
	    computer graphics i'll show and talk about several 
	    little projects i've been exploring over the last few 
	    years.</sentence>  <sentence>we'll look at techniques for making hidden 
	    line drawings of geometric objects.</sentence>  <sentence>i'll talk about
	    making and using reflection maps, a simple paint 
	    program for typeface design, and various image warping 
	    and image enhancement hacks.</sentence>  <sentence>i'll also show how simple 
	    filtering of mouse positions can help make the mouse 
	    more useable and fun as an input device, techniques for 
	    creating pictures with 6 point perspective, and a bunch 
	    of other half-baked stuff.</sentence>
