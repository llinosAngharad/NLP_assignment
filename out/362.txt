	learning control knowledge for scheduling

<paragraph><sentence>while the general class of most scheduling problems is np-hard in
worst-case complexity (i.e., a general solution is doomed to poor 
performance), in practice, for specific distributions of problems
and constraints, domain-specific solutions have been shown to perform
in much better than exponential time.</sentence>  <sentence>however, discovering these
search strategies is a knowledge-intensive time-consuming process
which requires a deep understanding of the domain.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>the goal of this work is to develop techniques to allow for automated
learning of effective domain-specific schedulers from a general
scheduler with a flexible control strategy.</sentence>  <sentence>in this approach,
techniques from machine learning and statistics are used to
automaticaly find control settings to for the scheduler which allow it
to improve performance on the domain-specific problems of interest.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>these techniques have been applied to learning control settings for a 
scheduler to schedule operations for the 26-meter subnet of the deep 
space network (dsn), operated by jpl and used to communicate with orbiting
spacecraft and satellites.</sentence>  <sentence>for dsn projected schedules, the machine learning
techniques were able to decrease the amount of cpu time required to
produce a schedule by 50% for problems solvable by the scheduler.</sentence>
<sentence>in addition, the machine learning allowed the scheduler to solve 15% more 
of the problems within computational resource limitations.</sentence></paragraph>

(this is joint work with jonathan gratch and gerald dejong of the
university of illinois)

<paragraph><sentence>steve is interested in meeting with anyone working on projects in planning,
scheduling and learning.</sentence> <sentence>if you are interested in meeting with steve, please
set up a time with carol (boshears@isl1.ri.cmu.edu).</sentence></paragraph>
