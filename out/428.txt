               supercomputer  interconnection networks

                          j. e. smith
                       cray research, inc.
                     chippewa falls, wi 54729

     multistage interconnection networks (mins) form the backbone
     of  traditional vector supercomputers.  <sentence>first, an historical
     perspective of mins in vector supercomputers is given.</sentence>  <sentence>this
     is  followed  by  the  description  of  an on-going study of
     large-scale vector-oriented  mins.</sentence>  <sentence>an  accurate  simulation
     model is described.</sentence>  <sentence>performance results are then presented;
     these results are focused on determining the relative impor-
     tance of several min characteristics.</sentence>

-----
jim smith was formerly with the university of wisconsin where he developed
the concept of the "decoupled access/execute architectures".  <sentence>he then went
on to build such a machine, the zs-1, for the astronautics corp. of america.</sentence>
<sentence>after seymour cray left to form cray computer, he joined cray research as
computer architect.</sentence>  the abstract may sound a little dry, but i think the
talk will not disappoint you, especially if you wonder what is happening in
this part of the supercomputer world [i don't want to say more; cray
research after all is the company that developed the cray x-mp and the 
cray y-mp.]  --trg
