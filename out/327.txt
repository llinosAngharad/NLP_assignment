		    fuzzy sets in approximate reasoning

			  friday, 26 april 1991
			    2:00-<etime>3:30</etime> <location>weh 5409</location>
    this  talk will present  the basic principles  of approximate reasoning
based on fuzzy sets   and relate  them  to   similar principles that  guide
probabilistic reasoning.  knowledge representation issues will be addressed
concerning the modelling and semantics of fuzzy rules.  some limitations of
the  fuzzy logic control algorithm will   be pointed out   in  the scope of
knowledge-based   systems.    in a   second    part,  an   introduction  to
possibilistic logic will  be provided.  possibilistic logic  is a  logic of
incomplete evidence that tries to reconcile fuzzy sets and classical logic.
it  also  belongs to  the  current   stream  of   research pertaining    to
non-monotonic reasoning and belief revision.

    didier dubois receives   his phd degree   in 1977.  he was a   visiting
scholar at the  school of electrical  engineering at  purdue  university in
1978.  from 1980 until 1983, he worked as a research engineer at center for
studies and research in  toulouse, in the production research  area.  he is
presently a cnrs researcher at the university of toulouse.  his main topics
of   interest   are the  modeling   of  imprecision  and  uncertainty,  the
representation  of knowledge  and  approximate reasoning for expert system,
operations research, and decision analysis.  he  is the  author or coauthor
of numerous publications, especially in  the field of  fuzzy sets and their
applications  to operations  research   and  artificial  intelligence.   he
coauthored (with h. prade) two  books  on fuzzy sets and possibility theory
and has coedited a volume on nonstandard logics  and several special issues
of scientific journals.  since  1979 he has also  been coediting busefal, a
bulletin on fuzzy sets and related topics.  he is on the editorial board of
the journals: fuzzy sets  and systems, international journal of approximate
reasoning, revue   d'intelligence  artificielle;  and  more recently:   the
international journal of general systems and the orsa journal on computing.
dubois is   a  member of  the  council of the  international  fuzzy systems
association.
