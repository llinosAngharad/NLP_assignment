 title: learning to understand information on the internet.</sentence>

<paragraph><sentence>the explosive growth in the number and diversity of information
sources on the internet is rapidly outstripping our ability to find
what we want.</sentence>  <sentence>browsers and indexing tools are practical, but only
partial, solutions to this problem.</sentence>  <sentence>a number of information gathering
agents have emerged.</sentence>  <sentence>however, because such agents require a
programmer to hand code a model of each information source in their
repertoire, they too are victims of information explosion.</sentence>  <sentence>this talk
explores automatically learning models of information sources as a
possible solution.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>i will describe ila, a domain-independent program that learns the
meaning of external information by explaining it in terms of internal
categories.</sentence>  <sentence>in one experiment, ila starts off with knowledge of local
faculty members, quickly learns a model of the internet service whois,
and then bootstraps to learn models of the personnel directories
available at berkeley, brown, cal-tech, cornell, rice, rutgers, and
uci.</sentence>  <sentence>ila's hypothesis language is first-order conjunctions, and its
bias is compactly encoded as a determination.</sentence>  <sentence>i introduce a
probabilistic model of ila that bounds its sample complexity, and show
when this bound is tighter than the famous haussler bound.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph>this talk is based on joint work with mike perkowitz</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>professor etzioni will be at cmu march 6, 7 and 8th.</sentence>  <sentence>if you would like an
appointment with him on monday, march 6, please send mail to plp@cs, or call
x8-7897 (phyllis).</sentence></paragraph>
