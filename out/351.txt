 title:		antarctic exploration robotics

<paragraph><sentence>cmu's dante robot will soon explore an active volcano in antarctica.</sentence> 
<sentence>dante is a remote geologist and a harbinger of polar and planetary robots.</sentence> 
<sentence>the exploration objective of the project is to study the gas from the lava 
lake.</sentence> <sentence>the robotics objectives of this program are to navigate the extreme 
terrain of the crater walls, and to operate in harsh conditions.</sentence> <sentence>the 
technical challenges include perception, locomotion and mission 
performance in planet-like conditions.</sentence> <sentence>the system envisioned for 
this exploration includes a novel walking robot, camera and scanner 
vision, scientific sampling devices, remote interfaces and a satellite 
data link for live feedback to the us.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>this seminar profiles the technical challenges with progress and 
approaches that address them.</sentence> <sentence>examples include a new laser range 
scanner for terrain modeling, non-contact foot sensing and mechanics 
for combining the tension of a climbing rope with the motions of a 
walking robot.</sentence> <sentence>a lab visit following the presentation provides the 
opportunity to view results to date.</sentence></paragraph>
