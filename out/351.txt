 title:		antarctic exploration robotics

<paragraph>cmu's dante robot will soon explore an active volcano in antarctica. 
dante is a remote geologist and a harbinger of polar and planetary robots. 
the exploration objective of the project is to study the gas from the lava 
lake. the robotics objectives of this program are to navigate the extreme 
terrain of the crater walls, and to operate in harsh conditions. the 
technical challenges include perception, locomotion and mission 
performance in planet-like conditions. the system envisioned for 
this exploration includes a novel walking robot, camera and scanner 
vision, scientific sampling devices, remote interfaces and a satellite 
data link for live feedback to the us.</paragraph>

<paragraph>this seminar profiles the technical challenges with progress and 
approaches that address them. examples include a new laser range 
scanner for terrain modeling, non-contact foot sensing and mechanics 
for combining the tension of a climbing rope with the motions of a 
walking robot. a lab visit following the presentation provides the 
opportunity to view results to date.</paragraph>
