 title: solving scheduling problems with the help of multi-agent systems

<paragraph>the talk presents work which was done in research project 331
information processing in autonomous mobile robot systems at
the technische universitaet in munich and in research project
aka-mod on modeling cooperative agents at the deutsches forschungszentrum</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>in the talk the multi-agent system magsy is presented firstly.</sentence>
<sentence>the kernel of an agent in magsy is a forward-chaining rule
interpreter.</sentence> <sentence>therefore, each agent has the problem solving
capacity of an expert system.</sentence> <sentence>each agent in magsy is a self-contained
entity with a unique identification.</sentence> <sentence>if an agent knows the identification
of another agent, it is able to send this agent messages.</sentence> <sentence>in doing so
the agents perform services and call on services of other agents.</sentence>
<sentence>agents are able to create new agents dynamically.</sentence> <sentence>if an agent
creates a new agent, it automatically knows the identification of
this new agent.</sentence> <sentence>the knowledge of the agents is structured in an
object-oriented knowledge representation scheme.</sentence> <sentence>there is a global
knowledge base which contains the knowledge that may be accessed
by all of the agents.</sentence> <sentence>agents may store their identification in this
global knowledge base and thus become known to all agents in the system.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>in the second part of the talk two applications which have been
implemented using the magsy system are presented.</sentence> <sentence>the first
example here is the design of a planning and controlling hierarchy
for a flexible manufacturing system with the help of magsy.</sentence> <sentence>the second
example is the design of a multi-agent system for modeling the transportation
domain.</sentence> <sentence>here a set of shipping companies each of which controls a set
of trucks has to execute client orders cooperatively.</sentence>
<sentence>in both examples a scheduling problem has to be solved.</sentence> <sentence>in the first case
a set of manufacturing orders has to be distributed to a set of
machine tools and in the second case a set of transportation orders
has to be distributed to a set of trucks.</sentence> <sentence>the talk will explain
the design of the multi-agent solutions for these two applications
and how the scheduling problem was solved in each case.</sentence></paragraph>
