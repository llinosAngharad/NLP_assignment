 title: an asynchronous team solution to scheduling steel plants
        in direct hot charge mode

in this talk, i will address the problem of direct hot charge scheduling of steel rolling mills in the primary steel making area (continous caster and hot strip mill). the work involved scheduling a huge order book (of approximately 5000 orders) with the objective of minimizing the operating costs, tardiness and inventory. this is a combinatorial problem due to complex constraints built into it.

	we proposed an asynchronous team solution for this domain. the intial schedules were generated by two different construction algorithms whose performance on the objective function was different from each other. i will present some preliminary results which show significant improvements in the evaluation costs when the above designs are integrated in the framework of ateams.

this research was carried out at ibm's t.j. watson research center over the summer of 1994. this work was performed jointly with  dr.sesh murthy of ibm.
