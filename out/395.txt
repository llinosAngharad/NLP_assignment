<paragraph>	  observations on massively parallel processors and
	     a case for a new theoretical model: logp</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>just a few years ago i doubted that massively parallel processors (mpp) 
and software would ever converge on a common foundation, which is 
absolutely essential if mpp is to become popular.</sentence> <sentence>today i can see that 
convergence, with a machine operating 1000 times faster than the
fastest cray computer being feasible in just a few years.</sentence>  <sentence>now i am 
concerned whether computer science in general (and computer 
science theory in particular) will take advantage of this opportunity
to contribute to and accelerate the success of massive parallelism.</sentence> </paragraph>

<sentence>this talk will first relay my (possibly controversial) observations:
1: we really can get to 1 teraflops(million mflops)!</sentence> <sentence>and soon!</sentence>
<sentence>2: computer science has an obligation as well as an opportunity in mpp.</sentence>
<sentence>3: mpp hardware organizations are converging, and early guesses at mpp 
	issues were wrong.</sentence>
<sentence>4: topology based models are not relevant for machines and software of the 90s.</sentence>
<sentence>5: current theoretical models (i.e., pram) may be too inaccurate to expect 
	them to lead to important contributions in mpp.</sentence>

<paragraph><sentence>this is followed by an introduction to a more realistic model, called "logp,"
developed by architects and theoreticians at berkeley.</sentence> <sentence>the name logp comes
from the four parameters of the model:</sentence></paragraph>

 <sentence>l: latency of communication in the network.</sentence>
 <sentence>o: overhead for the processor to send or receive a message from the network.</sentence>
 <sentence>g: gap between consecutive messages sent or received at a processor.</sentence>
 <sentence>p: number of processor/memory modules.</sentence>
