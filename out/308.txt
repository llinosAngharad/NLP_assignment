<paragraph>	  integrating knowledge sources in language comprehension</paragraph>

    multiple types   of  knowledge (syntax,  semantics,   pragmatics, etc.)
contribute to establishing the meaning of  an  utterance.  delaying the use
of   a knowledge   source    during   language   comprehension   introduces
computational inefficiency in the  form  of overgeneration.   on the  other
hand, ensuring that all relevant knowledge is brought  to bear as each word
in the sentence is understood is a difficult design problem.  as a solution
to this problem, we present  nl-soar, a language comprehension system  that
integrates  disparate knowledge sources automatically.  through experience,
the nature of the understanding process changes from deliberate, sequential
problem   solving to  recognitional  comprehension   that  applies all  the
relevant knowledge sources    simultaneously to  each word.     the dynamic
character of the system results directly from its implementation within the
soar architecture.</paragraph>
