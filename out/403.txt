                   cooperative agents:  machines and humans*

<paragraph><sentence>recently  we  have  embarked on an investigation of cooperative agents.</sentence>  <sentence>agents
can be mobile manipulators, observer-agents and human-agents.</sentence>  <sentence>the goal of this
research  is  to understand what architecture and representations are necessary
for a small team of agents engaged in a cooperative task.</sentence>    <sentence>the  task  can  be
material  handling  or  repair  in  generally  unstructured  environments.</sentence>  <sentence>the
architecture that we are striving for is advice taking and advice giving rather
than   utilizing  any  centralized  controller.</sentence>    <sentence>the  binding  force  is  the
cooperative will of each agent aiming to succeed  in  the  common  goal.</sentence>    <sentence>the
human-agent  serves  as a crisis manager who has capabilities to give advice to
any inquiring agent, since the human-agent keeps  an  updated  version  of  the
environment that the team operates in.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>in  this  talk, several intermediate results and lessons learned so far will be
presented.</sentence>  <sentence>examples from multisensory fusion, recognition of  shadows  through
color  and geometry will show the sensory capabilities necessary for navigation
and manipulation.</sentence>  <sentence>an example of two coordinated mobile  manipulators  carrying
an  object  will demonstrate mobile and manipulatory capabilities.</sentence>  <sentence>finally, we
shall outline a theoretical  model  which  helps  predict  complex  cooperative
behaviors.</sentence></paragraph>
