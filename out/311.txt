the autonomous learning problem (alp) is defined as: a series of training
examples is provided, characterized by a conjunction of specific values of a
set of common attributes, and a class to which it belongs.  the goal is to
construct an effective classifier for categorizing these examples.  the alp
is formulated as a set-covering problem, a set-partitioning problem, and as
a general 0-1 problem.  this enables an extnesive investigation to be
carried out as to the relationships between rules and examples; "data" and
"knowledge"; and attitudes regarding the "best" set of rules forming a rule
base".
