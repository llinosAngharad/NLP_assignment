future parallel computers must execute efficiently both hand-coded
applications and also programs written in high-level programming
languages.  today's machines limit programs to a single communication
paradigm---message-passing or shared-memory---which results in uneven
performance.  to address this problem, we have developed the tempest
interface, which supports shared-memory, message-passing, and hybrid
applications.  tempest enhances portability of parallel programs by
allowing low-cost networks of workstations to provide the same
abstractions (e.g., shared memory) as high-performance parallel
machines.

the tempest interface consists of low-level communication and
memory-system mechanisms.  policies, such as shared memory, are
implemented in user-level software, which allows programmers and
compilers to customize policies to an application's semantics and
sharing patterns.  experiments show that custom cache coherency
policies can produce upto an order-of-magnitude performance
improvement.

we have completed two implementations of the tempest interface.
typhoon illustrates the performance of first-class hardware support
for tempest.  this proposed hardware system implements tempest using a
fully-programmable, user-level processor in the network interface.
blizzard demonstrates tempest's portability by implementing the
interface in software running on stock hardware (a thinking machines
cm-5).  we are currently developing a third tempest implementation by
porting blizzard to the wisconsin cow (cluster of workstations).

this work is part of the wisconsin wind tunnel project, co-led by
mark hill, james larus, and david wood.
