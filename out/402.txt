vectorization techniques have proved to be extremely effective
for large-scale reservoir simulations.  parallel capabilities
hold even greater potential for these enormous problems.  domain
decomposition methods can allow the physical problem to be divided
up into many similar problems that can be addressed separately,
in parallel, on different processors.  these techniques also allow
efficient application of local grid refinement to resolve the
important local phenomena that may govern the flow process.
eulerian-lagrangian methods that follow the flow also can profit
extensively from parallel treatment of the characteristics of the
flow.  the effectiveness of these techniques will be demonstrated
on research codes and illustrative applications.
