                         disk reads with dram latency

<paragraph>one of the most difficult and (unfortunately) important challenges for a high
performance file system is the achievement of low latency during a file cache
miss.  we have recently begun a project to explore the feasibility and utility
of using file access hints to eliminate long disk latencies by prefetching
data.  these hints may have been issued explicitly by programmers,
automatically by compilers, speculatively by parent tasks such as shells
and makes, or historically by previously profiled executions.
our research will also address the thorny issues of hint specification,
memory resource management, imprecise and incorrect hints, and appropriate
interfaces for propagating hints to affected application, operating system,
file system, and device specific modules.</paragraph>

<paragraph>in this talk i will overview our research on this new project with
specific attention to our immediate plans, the most difficult problems
in front of us, and our long range vision for a hint-based prefetching
file system interface.</paragraph>

<paragraph>this is joint work with r. hugo patterson.</paragraph>
