in many applications such as geometric modeling and data compression, 
there arises the need to construct sparse approximations to discrete 
or piecewise linear curves and functions.
we consider such approximations with respect to several distance measures:
the chebyshev distance for functions, and the hausdorff distance and
parametric distance for curves.
the parametric distance aims to eliminate the unintuitive consequences of
the hausdorff distance arising from its treatment of a curve as a set of
points rather than as the locus of a point.
intuitively, the parametric distance p(a,b) between two curves a and b
is the length  of the shortest leash required if you were to
walk along curve a, and your dog walked along curve b, without backing up.
we present efficient algorithms for several problems in this context,
and state some open problems.
