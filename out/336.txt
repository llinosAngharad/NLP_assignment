    in this talk, i will first summarize applications of nonholonomic
    motion planning (nmp) to dextrous manipulation or assembly with a
    robotic hand, parking a vehicle with/without trailers, attitude
    control of a satellite using rotors or solar panel positioners,
    reconfiguration of a space structure (e.g., a space-station or a
    space platform/manipulator system) using internal motion and
    maneuvering in mid-air by a spring-board diver, a gymnast and a
    falling cat.  <sentence>then, i will describe the nature of nonholonomic
    constraints or nonintegrable conservation laws associated with
    each of the above systems and the formulation of nonholonomic
    motion planning problems.</sentence>  <sentence>i will show that a nmp problem is
    equivalent to the constructive nonlinear controllability problem
    of a nonlinear control system without drift.</sentence>  <sentence>i will also look at
    the existence of a motion problem for a nmp problem and highlight
    several new results we have obtained.</sentence>  <sentence>finally, i will present a
    simple but effective algorithm, called the basis algorithm, for
    computing near optimal solutions of a nmp problem, togther with
    simulation results.</sentence> <sentence>a simulation package implementing the basis
    algorithm will be discussed if time permits.</sentence>
