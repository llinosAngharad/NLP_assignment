<paragraph>the connection machine model cm-5 supercomputer is a massively
parallel computer system designed to offer performance in the range of
1 teraflops ($10^{12}$ floating-point operations per second).  the
cm-5 obtains its high performance while offering ease of programming,
flexibility, and reliability.  the machine contains three
communication networks: a data network, a control network, and a
diagnostic network.  this talk will describe the organization of these
three networks and how they contribute to the design goals of the
cm-5.</paragraph>

<paragraph>this work was done jointly with zahi s. abuhamdeh, david c.  douglas,
carl r. feynman, mahesh n. ganmukhi, jeffrey v. hill, w. daniel
hillis, bradley c. kuszmaul, margaret a. st.~pierre, david s. wells,
monica c. wong, shaw-wen yang, robert zak, and about 500 others.</paragraph>
