<paragraph>  <sentence>recent years have witnessed increasing interest in the theoretical
  aspects of real-time programming.</sentence>  <sentence>this has been fueled by the high
  costs associated with the failure of real-time systems.</sentence>  <sentence>this talk
  presents an extension of the testing paradigm of de nicola and
  hennessy for concurrent processes to reasoning about reactive
  real-time processes.</sentence>  <sentence>we generate testing preorders that relate
  processes on the basis of their timing behavior as well as their
  degree of relative nondeterminism.</sentence>  <sentence>the framework is then applied
  to two different scenarios.</sentence>  <sentence>in the first, relations are constructed
  that relate processes on the basis of all timing considerations.</sentence>  <sentence>in
  the second, relations are constructed that relate processes on the
  basis of their relative speeds.</sentence>  <sentence>we then isolate a realistic class
  of reactive systems that can be compared on the basis of their
  relative speeds.</sentence>  <sentence>an algebra is then developed for such processes,
  and examples are given to illustrate the utility of the approach.</sentence></paragraph>
