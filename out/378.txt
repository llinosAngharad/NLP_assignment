abstract: 

as has been the case for many years, the programming systems seminar will
take place mondays from <stime>3:30 </stime>to <etime>5:00</etime> in <location>weh 5409</location>, starting september 30.
for those new to cmu, the seminar features research presentations in the
general area of programming systems.  speakers include both invited guests
from outside cmu as well as faculty and students within cmu. it is an
excellent forum for faculty to discuss their research ideas, for students
to get some practice at delivering technical talks, and for everyone to
find out what others are doing.

i'd like to encourage you to attend the seminar. i would also like to
solicit your recommendations for speakers or topics. in particular, if you
have a talk you would like to give, or know of someone that i should
consider inviting, please let me know.

seminars will usually be announced on the scs bboard and cboard a few
days before the talk. i also keep a mailing list of people to notify by
e-mail. programming systems faculty are automatically on the list.
if you'd like to be included on the mailing list, too, let me know.

thanks and mark your calendar!
