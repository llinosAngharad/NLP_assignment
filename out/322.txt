<paragraph><sentence>we consider the problem of developing control programs for complex
mechanical systems with multiple, simultaneous tasks.</sentence>  <sentence>such systems are
difficult to program using traditional robot programming methods.</sentence>  <sentence>as a
concrete example, we consider the problem of controlling a human-like
machine to walk dynamically in three dimensions.</sentence>  <sentence>this problem has several
applications, including the design and construction of walking machines
capable of rough terrain mobility, computer graphic animation of complex
figures, and more distantly, understanding human walking.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>we describe a new framework called ``least constraint'' for programming
such a machine.</sentence>  <sentence>in this framework, we do not specify the desired motion in
terms of trajectories but rather more weakly as a collection of assertions
to hold.</sentence>  <sentence>these assertions are expressed as time varying inequality
constraints in various domains.</sentence>  <sentence>we thus attempt to capture the essential
requirements of a task without imposing unnecessary structure.</sentence>  <sentence>the
constraints are solved at run time to produce control torques.</sentence>  <sentence>constraint
satisfaction is performed using a fast iterative technique which takes
advantage of functional decomposition and automatic differentiation.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>the approach has been successful in generating stable dynamic walking with
various gaits.</sentence>  <sentence>we have implemented an object-oriented programming
environment for this purpose in common lisp using clos, and tested the
approach using a full rigid-body mechanics simulation.</sentence>  <sentence>we shall describe
the results of our simulation experiments with the aid of computer
animation.</sentence></paragraph>
