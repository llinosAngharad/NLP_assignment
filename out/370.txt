discussions can be rich opportunities for students to test their ideas,
compare views with others, work collectively to address problems or
issues, and receive feedback as they develop new analytical skills.  in
order to provide these opportunities, instructors need to be aware of
the various intellectual, social, emotional, and physical factors
affecting the class dynamics.  in this seminar we will discuss how
instructors can prepare themselves and their students to create
productive discussions.
