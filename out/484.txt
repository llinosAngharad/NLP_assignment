              household demand for garbage and recycling collection
                    with the start of a price per bag

                        **all are invited to attend**

<paragraph><sentence>this paper estimates household reaction to the implemenation of a
volume-based pricing program for the collecion of residential garbage.</sentence> 
<sentence>we gather original data on weight and volume of weekly garbage and
recycling of 75 households in charlottesville, virgina, both before and
after the implementation of a program which requires an eighty-cent
sticker on each bag of garbage.</sentence>  <sentence>this data set is the first of its kind.</sentence>
 <sentence>we estimate household demands for the collection of garbage and
recyclable material, the effect on the density of household garbage,
and the amount of illegal dumping conducted by housholds.</sentence>  <sentence>we also employ
a basic probit model to estimate the probability that a househod chooses
each of several methods available to reduce their garbage.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>in response to the implementation of this volume-based pricing program,
we find that households (1) reduced the weight of their garbage by
14.0%, (2) reduced the volume of garbage by 37.0% and (3) increased the
weight of their recyclable materials by 15.7%.</sentence>  <sentence>we estimate that
additional illegal -- or at least suspicious -- disposal accounts for
0.486 pounds per week per person in charlottesville, or 32% of the total
reduction in garbage observed at the curb.</sentence></paragraph>
