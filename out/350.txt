the most difficult problem to develop an autonomous biped robot is
the programming of the biped walking gaits, especially when the
robot needs to negotiate different terrain.  a neural gait
 synthesis mechanism is proposed to solve this problem.  the
 mechanism is implemented by using a gait synthesizer.  the gait
 synthesizer consists of a number of functional units including a
 central pattern generator, an adaptive unit, a  learning unit and
 a knowledge base. the central pattern generator is responsible for
 generating voluntary motion of the biped; the adaptive unit is
 used to modify the motion patterns generated by the central
 pattern generator for negotiating a new terrain; the function of
 the learning unit is to extract pattern features from newly
 learned walking gaits; and the knowledge base stores the pattern
 features along with terrain conditions.

most of the recent efforts have been on the adaptive unit.two
 neural networks have been developed to implement the adaptive
 unit.the first network consists of twenty reciprocally inhibited
 and excited neurons and is trained by a reinforcement learning
 rule.   two learning algorithms are introduced.  the primary
 concern of the first algorithm is the speed of gait modification,
 whereas the second algorithm provides a solution with minimum
 energy consumption.  the second neural network consists of an
 inverse and a feed forward models, and both are multi-layer
 perceptrons.  the network is trained by using a distal learning
 rule.  it is shown that the network generates an adequate gait
 pattern even with no direct teacher involved in the training.
  finally, simulation and experimental results will be presented.
