 title: 	multiple-model machine vision

<paragraph>images are fundamentally inhomogeneous, yet most machine vision work has
been based on homogeneous processing using a single type of image model.  we
have developed a framework for inhomogeneous, multiple-model machine vision
using a minimum description length (mdl)/maximum a posteriori (map)
selection criterion.  i will talk about how we have applied this framework
to the problem of multiple-object structure/egomotion from uncalibrated
video, and the problem of object recognition using 2-d aspect models.</paragraph>
