   ksr1: high performance and ease of programming,
          no longer an oxymoron

<paragraph><sentence>historically, shared memory has been the main line programming model from
an applications and computer science perspective for two reasons: shared
memory is a flexible and high performance means of communicating between
processors, tasks or threads and; shared memory provides high programming
efficiency through use of conventional memory management methods.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>the ksrl bridges the gap between the historical shared memory model and
mpps by delivering the shared memory programming model and all of its
benefits, in a scalable, highly parallel architecture.</sentence>  <sentence>the ksrl runs
a broad range of mainstream applications, ranging from numerically
intensive computation, to on-line transaction processing (oltp) and
database management and inquiry.</sentence>  <sentence>the ksrl's shared memory programming
model is made possible by a new architectural technique called allcache.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>this talk will start by describing allcache, a logical extension of virtual
memory and cache memory.</sentence>  <sentence>the shared memory programming model delivered by
allcache facilitates porting and high performance for customer and third
party applications.</sentence>  <sentence>within this context, the ksrl architecture and
applications environment consisting of a conventional unix based os
(symmetrically executing across all processors) and programming environment
(including conventional languages) will be described.</sentence>  <sentence>the talk will conclude
with a discussion of experiences porting customer specific and third party
applications.</sentence></paragraph>
