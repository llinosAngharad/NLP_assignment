<paragraph>computing transitive closure and reachability information in directed
graphs is a fundamental graph problem with many applications.  the
fastest known algorithms run in $o(min(mn,n^{2.38})$ time, where $n$
is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the graph.  it
is often the case that the aim is to compute the size of the
transitive closure and the number of nodes reachable from certain
nodes rather than computing them explicitly.  examples of potential
applications are database query optimization or optimizing
multiplications of large real-valued matrices.  we present an $o(m)$
time randomized algorithm that estimates the number of nodes reachable
from every node and the size of the transitive closure.  another
ramification of our estimation scheme is a $\tilde{o}(m)$ time
algorithm for estimating sizes of neighborhoods in directed graphs
with nonnegative weights.  our size-estimation algorithms are much
faster than performing the respective explicit computations and
improve significantly over previous estimation methods.</paragraph>
