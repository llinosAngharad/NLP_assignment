current  programming  languages  are  monoliths: they generally
cannot be composed with one another and each presumes it is the
only  language  to  be  used for solving problems.  <sentence>in order to
specify problem solutions in the way most suited to the problem
domain,   i   have  previously  advocated  the  use  of  `local
formalisms' --- languages designed by the  user  for  just  the
problem  at  hand.</sentence>  <sentence>in this talk, i describe tools which enable
monolithic  languages  to  be  broken  up  into   parameterized
component   sublanguages   and   recombined   with   a   user's
idiosyncratic language  to  solve  his  problem.</sentence>    <sentence>hence,  the
creative activity can be localized to concerns with the problem
domain rather than the  supporting  language  fabric,  such  as
expressions, statements, and procedures.</sentence>
