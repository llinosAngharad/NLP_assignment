 title:  the d* algorithm for real-time path replanning

<paragraph><sentence>the task of planning trajectories for a mobile robot has received
considerable attention in the research literature.</sentence>  <sentence>algorithms exist
for handling a variety of robot shapes, configurations, motion
constraints, and environments.</sentence>  <sentence>most of the work assumes the robot has
a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to
move; less attention has been paid to the problem of unknown or
partially-known environments.</sentence>  <sentence>this situation occurs for an
exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the
benefit of a floorplan or terrain map.</sentence>  <sentence>existing approaches plan an
initial global path based on known information and then modify the
plan locally as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors.</sentence>  <sentence>this
strategy works well in environments with small, sparse obstacles, but
it can lead to grossly suboptimal and incomplete results in cluttered
spaces.</sentence>  <sentence>an alternative approach is to replan a global path from
scratch each time a new obstacle is discovered.</sentence>  <sentence>this brute-force
approach is optimal, but it is grossly inefficient.</sentence>  <sentence>this talk
describes a new algorithm, d*, capable of planning paths in unknown,
partially-known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal,
and complete manner.</sentence>  <sentence>d* models the environment as a graph, where each
node represents a robot state, and each arc represents the cost of
moving between two states.</sentence>  <sentence>initially, a path is planned from the goal
to the robot's location using known information.</sentence>  <sentence>as the robot moves,
its sensors discover obstacles in its path.</sentence>  <sentence>these discoveries are
handled by modifying the arc costs.</sentence>  <sentence>d* propagates cost changes
minimally to compute a new optimal path.</sentence>  <sentence>the process repeats until
the robot reaches the goal or determines that it cannot.</sentence>    </paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>d* was implemented and compared head-to-head with the brute force
replanner to verify optimality and determine the performance
improvement.</sentence>  <sentence>it was integrated with an obstacle avoidance system and
tested on the navlab ii.</sentence>  <sentence>the robot succeeded in finding a specified
goal in a cluttered environment given no initial map information.</sentence>  <sentence>the
algorithm and the results will be presented.</sentence> </paragraph>
