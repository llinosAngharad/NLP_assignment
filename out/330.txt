 title:  product design for environmental compatibility

<paragraph>there is a growing interest in making products environmentally more
compatible.  while there is a need to make products and processes less toxic,
to increase recyclability, and to reduce waste; we have to try to achieve
environmental friendliness without compromising product quality.  this
approach to design has come to be called @i(green engineering design).  the
aim is to identify, develop, and exploit new technologies that can bolster
productivity without costing the environment.  the idea is to inject concerns
about environmental friendliness into the design process, where the assessment
of environmental friendliness is based on a life-cycle view of the product.
this includes the product's manufacturing process, distribution, use, and
final disposal.</paragraph>

we will examine a two part approach to green engineering: (1) the development
of special @i(green indicators) - measures of environmental
compatibility, and (2) tools that use the green indicators to help designers
assess, compare, and make design decisions.
