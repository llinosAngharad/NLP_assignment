<paragraph><sentence>in the coming decades, man will probably send robots to explore the solar
system.</sentence>  <sentence>in particular, we envision the need for mobile robots that can
navigate, map, and acquire samples on another planet, such as mars.</sentence>  <sentence>to
perform these tasks in such isolated and uncertain environments, the robots
must be highly reliable and fairly autonomous.</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>the cmu planetary rover project has built the ambler, a highly mobile and
energy efficient six-legged walking robot.</sentence>  <sentence>integrating the component
technologies of planning, perception and real-time control, we have
developed a system that autonomously walks the ambler over rugged terrain.</sentence>
<sentence>the talk will describe research results in real-time control of many degrees
of freedom, perception of rugged terrain using a laser range-finder, and
gait, footfall, and leg-recovery planning.</sentence>  <sentence>the components are integrated
using the distributed task control architecture (tca), which supports
concurrent planning, execution, monitoring, and error recovery.</sentence>  <sentence>the talk
will describe our integration efforts and the strategies employed for
ensuring reliable and competent performance of the ambler.</sentence></paragraph>
